## Introduction

SignPorts is a unique player warp plugin for Bukkit/Spigot servers that allows players to create and manage their own teleportation points using in-game signs. Unlike traditional warp plugins, SignPorts integrates seamlessly with the game world, providing an immersive and intuitive experience for players.

## Features

- Player-created teleportation points using signs
- GUI-based menu for easy navigation and management
- Customizable icons for each SignPort
- Cooldown system to prevent abuse
- Safe teleportation checks
- Admin controls and oversight
- Integration with GriefDefender for claim-aware functionality
- PlaceholderAPI support for dynamic text

## Unique Aspects

SignPorts stands out from other player warp plugins in several ways:

1. **Sign-Based System**: Instead of abstract warp points, players create physical signs in the world, adding a tangible element to teleportation.

2. **GUI Integration**: The plugin provides a user-friendly GUI for managing and using SignPorts, making it accessible for all players.

3. **Customization**: Players can set custom names, descriptions, and icons for their SignPorts, allowing for personalization and easy recognition.

4. **Claim Awareness**: Integration with GriefDefender ensures that SignPorts respect land claims and server rules.

5. **Safety Checks**: The plugin performs thorough safety checks before teleportation, preventing accidents and exploits.

6. **Immersion**: By using physical signs and custom icons, SignPorts maintains the immersive feel of the Minecraft world while adding convenient teleportation.

These unique aspects make SignPorts an excellent choice for servers looking to add player-controlled teleportation without breaking immersion or compromising server integrity.

```

## API and Hooks

SignPorts integrates with the following plugins:

1. **GriefDefender**: Used for claim awareness and protection.
2. **PlaceholderAPI**: Allows the use of placeholders in SignPort names and descriptions.

For developers, SignPorts provides an API for interaction with other plugins:

```java
// Example API usage
SignPorts signPortsPlugin = (SignPorts) Bukkit.getPluginManager().getPlugin("SignPorts");
SignPortAPI api = signPortsPlugin.getAPI();

// Get a SignPort
SignPortSetup signPort = api.getSignPortByName("ExamplePort");

// Teleport a player to a SignPort
api.teleportPlayerToSignPort(player, signPort);
```

## User Manual

### Creating a SignPort

1. Place a sign at the desired location.
2. Run `/signport create <name>` while looking at the sign.
3. Follow the prompts to set the icon, name, and description.

### Using the SignPorts GUI

1. Run `/signport gui` or `/signportmenu` to open the menu.
2. Click on a SignPort icon to teleport to that location.

### Editing Your SignPort

- To change the name: `/signport setname <new name>`
- To change the description: `/signport setdesc <new description>`
- To change the icon: Hold the desired item and run `/signport setitem`

### Removing a SignPort

Run `/signport remove <name>` to remove your SignPort.

## Admin Guide

### Managing SignPorts

- Admins can remove any SignPort using `/signport remove <name>`
- Use `/signport reload` to reload the plugin configuration

### Configuring the Plugin

1. Edit the `config.yml` file in the SignPorts plugin folder.
2. Adjust settings such as cooldown time and maximum SignPorts per player.
3. Save the file and run `/signport reload` in-game.

## Troubleshooting

- If a player can't create a SignPort, check their permissions and the `max-signports-per-player` setting.
- For teleportation issues, ensure the destination is safe and the player's cooldown has expired.
- If the GUI isn't working, verify that the server has a compatible version of the required dependencies.
